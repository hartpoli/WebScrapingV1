Web Scraping with Python
This Python script is designed to scrape a given website and extract all the links and images on the page. It can be easily modified to extract other types of data as well, such as text content, tables, and more.

Installation
To run this script, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

BeautifulSoup
requests
You can install these libraries using pip. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

Copy code
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
Usage
To use this script, simply replace the url variable with the URL of the website you want to scrape. Then run the script from the terminal:

Copy code
python scrape.py
The script will print all the links and images on the page to the console.

Modifying the Script
If you want to extract other types of data from the website, you'll need to modify the script. The key function for extracting data is parse_page(). This function takes a URL as input and returns a list of all the links and images on the page.

You can modify this function to extract other types of data as well. For example, if you want to extract all the text content on the page, you could modify the function like this:

python
def parse_page(url):
    # Make a GET request to the URL
    response = requests.get(url)

    # Parse the HTML content of the page using BeautifulSoup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

    # Find all the text content on the page
    text_content = soup.find_all(text=True)

    # Return the text content
    return text_content
This modified function will find all the text content on the page and return it as a list.

Conclusion
Web scraping can be a powerful tool for extracting data from websites. With Python and the BeautifulSoup library, you can quickly and easily extract links, images, text content, and more. This script is a starting point for your own web scraping projects.
